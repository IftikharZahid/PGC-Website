Act as a Senior Full Stack Developer. I want to build a modern College Management Website using React (Vite) for the frontend and Node.js (Express) for the backend.

1. Project Architecture:
   Outline the folder structure for both the client (React) and server (Node) directories.
   Explain how to connect the two (e.g., using a proxy or CORS).
2. Frontend (React):
   Create the main App.jsx with React Router set up for these pages: Home, Admissions, Courses, and Student Login.
   Write the code for a modern 'Navbar' component that is responsive.
   Suggest a UI library (like Tailwind CSS or Material UI) to keep the design modern and provide the basic setup steps for it.
3. Backend (Node.js/Express):
   Set up a basic server.js file.
   Create a sample API endpoint (GET /api/courses) that returns a JSON list of dummy courses (id, title, description).
   Show me how to fetch this data in the React 'Courses' page and display it.
